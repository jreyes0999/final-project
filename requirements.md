## Vision
* What is the vision of this product?
    - The vision of this project is to have a restaurant website for our wing shop. We want it to have a functional cart to be able to add food and remove food from the cart. 
    - This project doesn't exactly solve a pain point, but instead provides a new eatery in the local Memphis area, which expands Memphians options in catering. 
    - You should care about our product because we have the best wings in the Mid-South!
## Scope (In/Out)
* IN
    - Our website will provide various wing options including dips that the customer will be able to choose from. 
    - We will also include customer reviews for authenticity. 
* Out
    - We will not make it so that you are able to checkout. 
    - We will not offer delivery or other similar services. 
## Functional Requirements
1. Will be able to add food to cart. 
2. Will be able to check out our locations.
3. Will be able to check out our social media. 
## Data Flow
- The user will load to our homepage and read about what we're about, then they'll be able to use the navbar to check our locations, menu, social media, and more info about us. Then once a user decides what they want from our menu, they'll be able to add it their cart, ready for checkout.
