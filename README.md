# final-project by Jonathan and Alston

## Cooperation Plan
* The key strengths of Alston is HTML and my key strengths are JS and CSS.
* Alston will be able to work on the HTML and organize images on the webpages and I will work on the functionality of the websites as well as customization. 
* I wish to develop a greater strength in my ability to work on JS at a better pace as well as further developing my competency when it comes to coding things on the fly. 
* We plan to approach the day-to-day work by assessing progress consistently and communicating if either person needs help. 

## Conflict Plan
* We will sit down and see where we're stuck or whatever the problem may be and talk it out. We will try to come up with at least two ways to try to solve the problem we're facing along with using any resources available to us. 
* We'll have to divvy up the project so that doesn't happen. 
* Again, we'll have to make sure that questions are asked if help is needed and let each person focus on 
* We will bring it up and attempt to make amends to maintain a healthy partnership, but otherwise it'll have to be brought up to a TA. 

## Communicating Plan
* I will be available all day M-F. 
* We will use remo. 
* We will take breaks at least once an hour and take lunch. 
* The plan if we start to fall behind is to finish whatever we can as best as possible and focus on polishing what we have. 
* We will use slack after hours and on the weekend.

## Work Plan
* We will assign taks based on confidence in a certain language. 
* We will be using VSCode and Github.

## Git Process
* The entirety of the code will be live on Github including images. 
* I will share the repo with Alston via contributor email. 
* We both must review a PR and merge at least once every 3-4 hours. 


We decided that our project would be a restaurant style website about chicken wings. The website will have multiple webpages alongside a menu with multiple wing flavors and dips. The MVP would be to have at least two functional webpages alonside with a working menu and cart.
