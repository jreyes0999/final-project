# Alston Haynes and Jonathan Reyes Team Agreement
We have decided that our available hours that we decide to 
work on this project will be between the hours of 9am to 5pm 
we both understand how crucial taking breaks is and so we as a team we decided 
to keep our workload in those hours.

**Alston** is very good at structuring pages and organizing things so my biggest strength is
my ability to structure HTML documents.

**Jonathan's** biggest strength is CSS. He is an 
outstanding writer of CSS.
         
# Conflict Plan
Whenever arguments or conflicts start to happening, we would have to calm down and talk about what we have to focus on.
Contribution is key when it comes towards doing projects. One person doing all the work would defeat the purpose of working as a team.
Staying in contact with each other or having a schedule would help tremendously.

# Communication Plan
This topic will allow contacting easier. Our team members will hit each other on different platforms, via social media, text message, etc.
We don't want to work 24/7 so deciding an off day would be best for us. Falling behind on the project would mean working harder and making this more stressful than it already is.
During presentation day we will all go one by one on who all as commited to the project.

# Work Plan
By establishing a group chat. This will be a civil reminder of what work is being done.

# Git Process
We would establish a coding that each person's comfortable with. Everyone has to commit something no matter if it's good or bad, we'll figure out how to work on it.
The person that made the repo will be the one that team will be commiting and making changes to. Uploading folders with files that contain work about the project would also
help out a lot.
