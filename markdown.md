# Alston Haynes and Jonathan Reyes Team Agreement
We have decided that our available hours that we decide to 
work on this project will be between the hours of 9am to 5pm 
we both understand how crucial taking breaks is and so we as a team we decided 
to keep our workload in those hours.

**Alston** is very good at structuring pages and organizing things so my biggest strength is
my ability to structure HTML documents.

**Jonathan's** biggest strength is CSS. He is an 
outstanding writer of CSS.
